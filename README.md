in the average case
in the worst case
```

## 1-insertion_sort_list.c
function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

## 2-selection_sort.c
function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
Write in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

## 3-quick_sort.c
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.
The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.

Write in the file 3-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
